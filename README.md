# CRUD React.js + Laravel

Full stack web application that integrate  React.js in the Front-end to create the user interface and Laravel 11 to create the Back-end.

React.js project created using VITE so it would be faster as I'm using a more recent technology. Furthermore, I implement the react-router-dom V6 library so I can create routes to navigate between different views. 

vite + react-router-dom allowed me to create a powerfull Front-end application. faster and smoother than others, with mininum errors at compilation time.

On the other hand, I used Laravel for the back-end beacuse is a web framework that allows me to create Restfull APIs faster so I can implement all the logic of my project and do operations on tables of my data base
